## Notes

This bar is mainly made for my personal use, that means, for two screens (Hdmi and laptop screen).

Feel free to use for learning, and your own space, but you might want to change the number of screen used.

### Other notes

My mother language is spanish, so I might use spanish variables, and mix them with english variables (sorry)
